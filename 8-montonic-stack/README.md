A monotonic stack is a data structure that is used to maintain the elements in a monotonic order. There are two types of monotonic stacks:

**Monotonic Increasing Stack**: 
elements are always in increasing order from the bottom to the top of the stack. 

As new elements are pushed onto the stack, any elements that are greater than the new element are popped off to maintain the increasing order.

**Monotonic Decreasing Stack**: 
elements are always in decreasing order from the bottom to the top of the stack. 

As new elements are pushed onto the stack, any elements that are smaller than the new element are popped off to maintain the decreasing order.
